### Capstone-Project-Python
project on python
###### overview
We have 3 tables of project,employee and seniority level and we’ve to create dataframe for these tables and write code for 8 scenarios.
###### Question
• There are three different tables as given above. Please make three dataframe in python and save them as three .csv files. From Task 2 to Task 10, use the saved .csv files only

• The cost column in the dataframe “Project” has some missing values. Your task is to compute these missing values. Replace the missing values by running average. You should use the “For” loop for this task

• Split the name column in the Employee dataframe into two new columns “First Name”,and “LastName” and remove the older “name” column

• Join all three dataframes in one single dataframe. Name it “Final”

• Add a new bonus column in the Final dataframe. Give a 5% bonus concerning project cost only to employees who have finished the projects

• Demote the designation level by 1, whose projects have status “fail”. Delete the employees record whose designation level is above 4

• Add “Mr.” and “Mrs.” to the first name column and drop the gender column

• Promote designation level by 1 for the employees whose age is more than 29 years using IF condition

• Add the cost of all projects for each Employee and save it in new dataframe “TotalProjCost” with three columns ID, First Name, and Total cost

• Print all the employee details whose city name contains the letter “o” in it

###### Action: 

•	Created 3 dataframe for the tables. Splitted the employee dataframe to first name and last name and removed the older name column.

•	We have joined all the 3 dataframe to create a final dataframe and added bonus column and demoted and promoted the employees designation based on the request.

•	Used various functions from Python libraries NumPy and Pandas to complete the assigned tasks.
